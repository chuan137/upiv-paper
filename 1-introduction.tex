Who proposed the defocusing method the first time? Sample pictures of the method. 
Speidel et al. (2003), Wu et al. (2005), Park und Kihm (2006)


Overview of the different communities and application that use the method


Previous work of of other groups, available open source applications, commercial applications?

Why does optimization of standard applications make sense?


Measures to accelerate analysis of PIV code. Estimate individual optimization potential. 
\begin{itemize}
