\section{Ring detection}

we are facing deficulties
\begin{enumerate}
\item fuzzy 
\item uneven brightness
\end{enumerate}

Hough transform.
common strategy is to apply an edge detection before HT.
Images of micro particles are fuzzy, does not have a crisp edges. 
Signals can be very close to the background.
We imporve the contrast to gain higher SNR instead of edge detection.
